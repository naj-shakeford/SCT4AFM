# Supply Chain Traceability for Agri-Food Manufacturing

This repository contains information models and data sets developed by the
Engineering Laboratory's [Supply Chain Traceability for Agri-Food Manufacturing](https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/supply-chain-traceability-agri-food-manufacturing) project.

We are developing a machine-readable semantic model of entities and tracking events to enable grain production traceability. This model will provide guidance to supply chain stakeholders in both understanding what data must be collected for traceability and in identifying gaps in relevant standards. Increasing traceability of grain products reduces risk for producers and enables safer food and feed by allowing rapid determination of the source and the scope of contaminated material.  This in turn increases trust and safety in the agri-food supply chain.
