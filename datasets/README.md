# Folder for sets of Tracking Data
This project created a number of sets of data simulating Critical Tracking Event occurrences during a portion of the lifecycle of quantity of material such as grain (e.g. soybeans or feed corn) to use in testing our models. These datasets can be used by others to exercise: models, visualizations, or applications intended for understanding the genealogy of a quantity of grain through traceability data. These synthetic data include information about the type of CTE occurring, when it occurred, other entities involved and there roles, and relevant characteristics of the material or item that is the primary subject of the event.
