# Folder for Semantic Traceability Models
This project investigated two different approaches for defining ontologies for Critical Tracking Events (CTEs) and Key Data Elements (KDEs):
* Extending an upper ontology, the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO)
* Using ontology modules
Subfolders will be created for artifacts from each of these approaches.

## Folder Status
This site is still in the process of being built, so subparts of this folder and its expected contents are likely not present yet.
