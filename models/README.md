# Folder for Semantic Traceability Models
This project investigated two different approaches for defining ontologies (i.e. semantic models) for Critical Tracking Events (CTEs) and Key Data Elements (KDEs):
* Extending an upper ontology, the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO)
* Using ontology modules
In each case, ontologies were created in the [Web Ontology Language (OWL)](https://www.w3.org/TR/2012/REC-owl2-overview-20121211/), a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) standard logic language for expressing ontologies. Subfolders will be created in this repository for artifacts from each of these approaches.

## Folder Status
This site is still in the process of being built, so subparts of this folder and its expected contents are likely not present yet.
