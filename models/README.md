# Folder for Semantic Traceability Models
This project investigated two different approaches for defining ontologies (i.e. semantic models) for Critical Tracking Events (CTEs) and Key Data Elements (KDEs), which are the key notions related to traceability for food.  The two approaches were:
1. Extending an upper ontology, the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), using the principles of the Industrial Ontology Foundry 
2. Using ontology modules

The first approach was pursued by a team from the Engineering Informatics Research Group (INFONEER) at Texas State and from the NIST Supply Chain Traceability (SCT4AFM) project.  This focused on incrementally, developing and then using a traceability model to address domain user needs with respect to particular scenarios for grain supply chains.

The second approach was lead by a team from the Data Semantics Laboratory (DaSe Lab) at Kansas State University.  It was focused on excersizing a modular modeling approach and methods to develop a rich ontology for full end-to-end traceabilty of grain supply chains.  The full team involved in the development of this model included the same NIST SCTAFM project members as above, the principle investigator from the Texas State team, and domain experts involved in traceability projects at the AgGateway standards consortium supporting digital connectivity in global agriculture.

In both cases, these models were seeded with CTE and KDE notions developed in prior research of the SCT4AFM project. In each case, ontologies were created in the [Web Ontology Language (OWL)](https://www.w3.org/TR/2012/REC-owl2-overview-20121211/), a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) standard logic language. Subfolders will be created in this repository for artifacts from each of these approaches.
