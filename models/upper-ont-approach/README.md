# Upper Ontology Based Traceability Ontology
Texas State University (TSU) and NIST have created an OWL model for supply chain traceability by extending the Basic Formal Ontology using the approach of the Industrial Ontology Foundry (IOF). The resulting ontology is provided in this repository. This ontology has been shown to be useful in mapping, integrating, visualize and querying data describing Critical Tracking Events (CTEs) associated with the lifecycles of harvested grain.
